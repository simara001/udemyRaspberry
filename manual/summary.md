This is a true opportunity to create an iOS application from nothing. A really basic knowledge of any programming language is required, and the forum is opened for any question you may have. Instead of trying to put a lot of material from different areas, we are using the tools that exist on the internet, that will make our life simpler. Creating an application can be really expensive. Depending on the source, creating an app can be extremely expensive if you don't have the knowledge ([You can read this article](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2013/11/24/much-cost-develop-app-true-expense-starting-scratch/?utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=share%20button&awesm=tnw.to_qBLM&utm_campaign=social%20media&utm_content=How%20much%20does%20it%20cost%20to%20develop%20an%20app?%20The%20true%20price%20of%20starting%20from%20scratch)). So, why don't you give a shot at this course and try to create your own application instead of expending a lot of money. 

### What is the content of this course?

This course covers 3 different areas at some extend. Mainly we will talk about Objective-C (iOS native Language), but we will also cover the integration with the back-end substitute **Parse**. We will use it to create a Sign Up form and we will also use the **Facebook API** to give the opportunity to the users to Sing In using its **Facebook** account. In addition, we will use **ESPN API** to get the latest news on the market from different sports and display on the general screen. We will create a Profile section where the user can upload a *Profile Picture* to be identified. Finally, we will beautify the application using **Sketch** a popular (and relatively cheap alternative to Photoshop) design program used in Mobile and Web Development. You can find a detailed explanation in the next section.
