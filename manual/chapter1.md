## Prerequisites

#### Install Git

There are couple of ways to download the files. In fact, one of the popular ways to install a package in the developer community (that uses Mac OS) is to use brew (Homebrew). In case you want to experiment a little bit follow this [link](http://brew.sh/). The second approach (and the one I recommend for beginners) is basically download the files and install it as a regular package, just follow this [link](http://git-scm.com/download/mac) to install it. After the installation, you need to check everything worked well. Go to your `Applications`, open `Terminal` and write `which git`; you should see something like `/usr/bin/git`.

#### Installing XCode

Go to your `Applications` open `App Store`, search for XCode and download it. It might take a while, also you should have at least 2.5 GB of free space on your hard disk.
