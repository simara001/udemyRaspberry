## Introduction to XCode

In this lesson we will cover:

+ Introduction to XCode (Really basic introduction)
+ Open XCode
+ Inspect the 3 main bars (Navigation, Debug Area and Utilities)
+ Inspect the Storyboard of the project
+ How to put UILabels on the storyboard
+ How to change the color of the background
+ How to visualize the Storyboard on the iPhone Simulator

#### Open XCode

You can open XCode in 3 different ways:

+ Go to Finder > Applications > XCode 
+ Go to Spotlight > Write `XCode` (Spotlight: search icon at the top right of your screen)
+ Download `Alfred`, open it, and write `XCode`

#### Inspect the 3 main bars (Navigation, Debug Area and Utilities)

You will need these 3 bars in different moments. You can enable/disabled any bar on the top right icons (3 different icons) of your XCode Screen (Please be sure XCode is selected). I am going to give you a quick guide when you will need the bars:

**Navigation Bar:** this bar is a resource to see the structure of your files, probably the most important (and used) view on this bar is the *Project Navigator* which shows the files on your project.

**Debug Area:** in this area you will see all the logs that you have on your project, also, you can debug your project if you are using debugging marks.

**Utilities:** this is a really important part for the configuration of your storyboard. You can see the class of the elements, and you can see what is called *attribute inspector* that shows and configure extra information about the elements you are using.

#### How to put UILabels on the storyboard

Basically you need to open the Storyboard, find the UILabel element on the `Utilities Bar`, drag and drop it to your Storyboard. To configure it, select the element and go to the `Attribute Inspector` inside the `Utilities Bar`.
