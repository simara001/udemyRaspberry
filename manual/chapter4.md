### Cron Jobs

The first step would be to give execution permission to your `test1.py`.

```bash
$ chmod +x test1.py
```

In order to create a **Cron job** we should edit the crontab file:

```bash
$ crontab â€“e
# scroll to the bottom of the page
```

An example of Cronjobs can be found in the next examples:

This first example is a bash file that is executed it every day of the week, every month at 20:00 hours.

| 0           | 20         | *         | *           | *                 | /home/pi/on.sh 25 |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | 
| Minute(:00) | Hour (8pm) | Every Day | Every Month | Every Day of Week | path to command   |

This example is a bash file that is executed it all the weeks from Monday to Friday, every month at 20:00 hours.

| 0           | 20         | *         | *           | 1-5               | /home/pi/on.sh 25 |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | 
| Minute(:00) | Hour (8pm) | Every Day | Every Month | Monday to Friday  | path to command   |

This example is a bash file that is executed every 5 minutes all the time.

| */5                | *          | *         | *           | *                 | /home/pi/on.sh 25 |
| ------------------ | ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | 
| Every five minutes | Hour (8pm) | Every Day | Every Month | Every Day of Week | path to command   |

The first time, you will have the next error:

```bash
$ (CRON) info (No MTA installed, discarding output)
```

Which basically means we need to install an external library:

```bash
$ sudo aptitude install postfix
```

Once you finish this, you should receive a message generated by the script on:

```bash
$ cat /var/mail/pi
# You should see something like:
> From root@gmail.com (Cron Daemon)
> To: pi@gmail.com
> Subject: Cron: ...
> Content-Type: ...
> Message-Id: ...

> hello world
