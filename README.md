Welcome to this Raspberry Pi Introduction!
=======

In this manual we will see how to put a *Python* script on a cronjob. We will assume we have a blank *SD Card*, we will download the latest version of the Raspberry Pi OS, install it, configure SSH, install GIT, create a *Python* script, call it with a cronjob, and put the data on a SQLite3 local DB. In case this is what you need, don't hesitate to read the next manual.
